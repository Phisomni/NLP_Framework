# College Course Catalog NLP Analysis

This project uses an extensible NLP framework to analyze and visualize department-level differences in language across Northeastern University's academic course catalogs. It is built for the DS3500 Extensible NLP assignment.

---

## Project Overview

We explore how different academic departments describe their courses by comparing metrics like:

- Keyword frequencies
- Readability scores
- Sentiment
- Average word and sentence lengths
- Lexical richness (type-token ratio)

The output is a set of insightful visualizations that help reveal how disciplines differ in tone, accessibility, and vocabulary.
